## process

The design process always starts with youâ€” beginning with an introductory questionnaire and an online or in-person consultation, followed by the design and personalization of your paper goods. Everything is done by hand, from illustrations, calligraphy, down to the last wax seal.

### WE CHAT

Because each couple is always different, I work closely with you to develop the brief of your order.

After I receive the initial inquiry, I send an introductory questionnaire that covers all the basics of your wedding day. Then we discuss your vision and paper needs, either online or in-person. Your wedding day is at the core of my design process, so I want as many details as I can get.

### WE FINALIZE DETAILS

When it comes to the design details, leave them to me. I make sure everything from materials to the final turnaround date is in line with your budget and wedding plans. I send a proposal of what your order looks like and includes for your review.

Once I receive a completed contract and deposit, I reserve your order and we begin the content phase. This might include gathering photos and guest addresses, to finalizing wording.
